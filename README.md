This program scrapes the site https://pricehistory.app/ for price updates
Pasting the URL leading to a specified product page on the aforementioned website initializes the program
Fetch button is simply for aesthetic purposes
Click on anyone of the five other buttons to get the price details for a product after pasting the product URL
An example URL would be: https://pricehistory.app/p/sony-wh-ch720n-wireless-over-ear-active-8SnzAo2h
